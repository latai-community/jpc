# JPC - Java + Python + CMD Shell Library

## 🌎 About the LATAI Community

JPC is a project developed under the **LATAI (Learning AI Through AI) Community**, an open-source initiative where AI is used to generate **software, documentation, and research**. Instead of manually developing every component, we leverage **AI models** to create code, automate documentation, and optimize workflows, making this a unique experiment in AI-assisted software development.
