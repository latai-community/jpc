# JPC - Java + Python + CMD Shell Library

## 🌎 About the LATAI Community

JPC is a project developed under the **LATAI (Learning AI Through AI) Community**, an open-source initiative where AI is used to generate **software, documentation, and research**. Instead of manually developing every component, we leverage **AI models** to create code, automate documentation, and optimize workflows, making this a unique experiment in AI-assisted software development.

## 🚀 About JPC

JPC (**Java + Python + CMD Shell Library**) is a **cross-platform automation tool** designed for **file management, text processing, and system automation**. It provides a simple **CLI and programmatic interface** to streamline repetitive tasks for developers and power users.

This library enables **batch file handling, advanced text processing, and system command execution** in a way that is intuitive, scriptable, and efficient, making it ideal for both manual and AI-driven workflows.

## 🔹 Key Features

As of March 2025, here are the main features:

### **🗂 File Operations**

✅ Batch rename files using patterns or regex.  
✅ Move, delete, and copy files in bulk.  
✅ Create, extract, and manage ZIP files.  
✅ Search for files and directories based on specific criteria.  

### **📝 Text Processing**

✅ Trim, format, and clean up text.  
✅ Find and replace text across multiple files.  
✅ Convert case (uppercase, lowercase, capitalize, swap case).  
✅ Extract specific patterns from text files (e.g., emails, URLs).  

### **💻 System Automation**

✅ Run batch scripts and execute system commands.  
✅ Interact with the clipboard (copy/paste automation).  
✅ Monitor and list running system processes.  
✅ Perform scheduled file operations via scripting.  

### **🌍 Multi-Language Support**

✅ Available for use via **Java, Python, and CMD Shell (Windows 11)**.  
✅ Command-line (CLI) and API-based access for easy scripting.  
✅ Future scope: Support for **Linux/macOS**.

## 📌 Why Use JPC?

- **Unified Automation**: Instead of using multiple external tools, JPC provides a **single library** for various automation needs.  
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Future versions will integrate with AI to **suggest automation tasks, optimize scripts, and auto-generate commands**.  
- **Developer-Friendly**: Designed for software engineers, system admins, and AI workflows.  

---

## 🏗 Installation  

JPC will soon be available as:

- A **Java Library** (`.jar` package) for integration into Java projects.  
- A **Python Package** (`pip install jpc`) for Python users.  
- A **Standalone Executable** for direct CMD Shell usage.  

We may also include an official installer. Stay tuned for installation details!

## 🔧 Usage Examples

We will update the example as soon as the code is generated. But the idea is something like this:

### **Example 1: Replacing Text in Multiple Files**

```shell
jpc -replace "old_text" "new_text" *.txt
This command will search all .txt files and replace old_text with new_text.
Example 2: Using JPC in JShell (Java REPL)
jshell> /env -class-path jpc.jar
jshell> import jpc.StringUtils;
jshell> String text = "   Hello  World!  ";
jshell> String trimmed = StringUtils.trim(text);

Example 3: Copying Files in Python

from jpc import FileManager
FileManager.copy("source.txt", "destination.txt")
